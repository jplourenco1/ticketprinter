Things to do here in order of priority:

Implement feature to run commands and send the output to the ticket.
Implement 'template' command line option or data field to set a specific template.
Implement 'components' data field on YAML to set the components used.
Implement 'labels' data field on YAML to set the labels used.
Change data structure so each case have its own set of commands.
Implement JIRA validation of user and pass, optionally storing them on a cache file. 
Implement components listing using components API, maybe also implement editing and deleting them.

Future improvements, to do after the above features are implemented:

A menu interface, with options to the main features and using $EDITOR to edit templates.
Investigate Zephyr API, propably we could implement a feature to include the generated tickets on a specific test folder
